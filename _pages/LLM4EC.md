# WCCI 2026 Special Session: *Large Language Models Meet Evolutionary Computation â€” Towards Synergistic Intelligence*

## Overview

The convergence of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Evolutionary Computation (EC)** opens new research directions where language-based reasoning and open-ended search complement each other.
This special session explores the *synergistic intelligence* emerging from their interaction.

**Conference:** IEEE WCCI 2026 (CEC Track)  
**Organisers:** Xingyu Wu, Yuejiao Gong, Liang Feng, Kay Chen Tan
