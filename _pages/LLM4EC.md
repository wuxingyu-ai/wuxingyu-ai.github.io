# WCCI 2026 Special Session: *Evolutionary Computation Meets Large Language Models: Foundations, Synergies, and Emerging Paradigms*

## Overview

The rapid rise of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** has profoundly reshaped artificial intelligence research and practice, extending beyond natural language processing to influence reasoning, decision-making, and optimization. In parallel, **Evolutionary Computation (EC)** continues to advance as a powerful global optimization framework characterized by adaptability, scalability, and robustness. The convergence of these two paradigms has given birth to a new frontier in computational intelligence, where human-like reasoning meets large-scale evolutionary search.
This Special Session aims to provide a dedicated forum for exploring the bidirectional synergy between LLMs and EC, spanning theoretical foundations, algorithmic innovation, and real-world applications. From one direction, LLM-enhanced EC leverages the rich knowledge, generative capability, and reasoning skills of LLMs to drive new forms of intelligent evolutionary operators, algorithm generation, and explainable optimization. From the other direction, EC-enhanced LLM employs evolutionary search to optimize prompts, architectures, and model behaviors in closed-box or multi-objective settings, thereby improving efficiency, interpretability, and adaptivity. Together, this interplay opens up promising pathways for developing next-generation AI systems that integrate language understanding, optimization, and self-improvement.
This special session explores the *synergistic intelligence* emerging from their interaction.

**Conference:** IEEE WCCI 2026 (CEC Track)
